# Icon Placeholder Files

The extension needs icon files in PNG format for different sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should feature a robot or chatbot icon with an arrow or prompt symbol to indicate automatic prompt injection.

For now, you can:
1. Use the icon.svg as a template
2. Convert it to PNG files at the required sizes
3. Or create simple colored squares as placeholders

The current build will work without these files, but the extension icon won't appear properly in the browser toolbar.

## Design Guidelines
- Use the brand colors: #667eea (primary blue) and #764ba2 (secondary purple)
- Include a robot/chatbot symbol
- Add an indication of automation (arrow, prompt symbol)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
